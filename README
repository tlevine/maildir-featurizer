Get features of a maildir very quickly, by not opening the files.

As a side effect, the features reveal little private information.

I made this for my dada portal; I wanted to be able to analyze my
emails in the context of other things, but I didn't want to have
sensitive information in my dada portal.

It implements only a subset of the maildir filename format.
