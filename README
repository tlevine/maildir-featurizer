Get features of a maildir very quickly, by not opening the files.

As a side effect, the features reveal little private information.

I made this for my dada portal; I wanted to be able to analyze my
emails in the context of other things, but I didn't want to have
sensitive information in my dada portal.

It implements only a subset of the maildir filename format.
(http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html).

I use it like this to find only the emails I sent. ::

    ./maildir_featurizer.py my-maildir/*/*/Sent/

Or, if you install it, ::

    maildir-featurizer my-maildir/*/*/Sent/

Or, from Python, which is how I really use it, ::

    from maildir_featurizer import messages
    for message in messages('my-maildir'):
        print(message)
